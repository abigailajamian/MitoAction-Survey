Socially, it is very challenging for me as an adult to build or maintain a social network because our health is so unreliable and we cannot participate in physical activity others enjoy.  For me, I spent years believing this was EDS and used to just tell myself well it is what.it is and it is not degenerative so suck it up and push through. Now I struggle because I did a lot of damage doing that and now I am having to learn a new mindset at 35 for managing my own life while trying to provide care and advocacy for my child and help guide her down a better path.  For my child, the impact on her daily life to her seems minimal most times because we have worked so hard.to build in mechanisms to make this a reality for her. But as she gets older, these mechanisms are setting her apart from others and are starting to draw attention as much as her challenges do. For example, the school provides climate controlled busing per her IEP but the school only has small white athletic buses to do this which are primarily used for children with severe behavioral issues so she is being laughed at for ""riding the short bus"" and being a bad kid. She cannot manage the temperature extremes for outdoor recess slmany days of the year so she has to stay inside but no one else is asked to stay and play with her so she becomes isolated. During gym, they do.not want to modify her curriculum yet and so she does what others do with the understanding she may have to walk when they run, but no one wants to be on her team and they get frustrated when running as a group because the teacher does not allow the class to pass so while she starts at the back soon everyone is stuck behind her because she is still very slow and uncoordinated. She has to go to the nurse for medication 2 or 3 times a day which draws more attention. All of these issues are becoming more and more predominant as she ages and the differences become more apparent as even the late bloomers begin to grow out of the awkward running and inability to ride bikes but she does not. So far she has managed to make a few friends she talks to over the computer to play games which is a huge asset to her because this is something she can do without feeling left out but often gets left behind other times because her body just cannot keep up.",See previous question response about my child,"The financial impact is severe with the continuous cost of healthcare, no covered cocktail items, travel for care, and accessories such as canes, peds wheelchair, cooling vests, cooling towels, fans, etc to make it possible to function.

In my situation, I needed to keep my job for the medical insurance to help with all my medical bills. My bosses made my last year there terrible for my mental and physical health. The more they put on me to do the worse I got as an employee. I got to the point where I could not get all the work done, finally did not have the mental or physical ability to continue working. They were going to fire me but one of them gave me the chance to file for disability through our state. Within 4 months I was on disability and out of there. It took months before I could actually have days that I felt good. My husband knows what this disease does too you and understands when I am not having a good day. My family understands also. Friends ask to have you spell it for them first thing. Then I explain it, but I still don't think they get it and how bad it can be. My friend understands when I am down and have too cancel plans.

He was a normal baby and toddler until at age 2 1/2 developed nystagmus and then at age 3 diagnosed with optic atrophy and legal blindness.  His dad and I were devastated. His hearing was still normal as well as his balance.  We never knew he would also lose both.  Joe went to a day school for blind children from age 6-13 when by then had lost too much hearing and had to transfer to another day  school for blind or blind & deaf children. Both schools were in our area. He started to learn tactile sign language and hated it but he was a fast learner. He could still speak and could hear some with a hearing aid.  He was cojpletely deaf by age 18. He could still stand and walk until age 25 then he started to use a walker with wheels. at age 34 he was in the wheelchair.   He was a braille and computer user until he could no longer feel the dots in books or on his braille display for 10 years now. He misses his books and computer terribly.     He hates being in the wheelcahir and that his legs and feet keep moving. His mind is fine. I use tactile sign and fingerspelling to communicate and so does he as his speech is gone also except for some sounds. He is very stable emotionally and spiritually. But very very physically disabled.  He has personal assistances for about 8 years who come to our home on different shifts to help him out of bed and in the bathroom and getting dressed.  He used to be able to transfer himself,  It was a very hard adjustment for Joe to accept so much help but we both knew he needed it.  He used to have to lay on the floor to get his pants on and he would fall different times and I would call 911 lift and assist to help him up and back in the wheelchair.  His loss of independence has been very difficult but somehow he manages and he always says, ""I am not giving up"".  We have 9 different people come in and our of our house every week. 5 different personal assistants and 4 people who use tactile sign to communicate and socialize with Joe.  3 are deaf and 1 is hearing.  JOe also goes to a gym 2 times a week for 18 years where a personal trainer helps him on and off the equipment.  They have given him the scholarship for those 18 years.  It is called Fighting Back Scholarship  Program in Malvern, PA.  He loves it!  It is the best thing he does every week. We also go to a mass for the deaf for over 40 years and he has an interpreter at the mass.  It is very important to Joe to practice his faith.  The priests are his friends and come to visit as do other friends.  JOe has always been social and makes and keeps friends for many years.  He is very witty and pleasant and has a great memory for books he read when he could still feel braille and memories of his childhood and all the things  he used to be able to do before he became so disabled.  He enjoys telling people about his life experiences. Our life has been a serious of adjustment the worse was when his dad died 24 years ago but we both keep finding ways to improve.  He has 2  healthy sisters and 3 nephews and 1 niece.  We have a nice family.  Financially, Joe has medicare and medicaid which covers most everything.
