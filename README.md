# MitoAction Survey Analysis
MitoAction is a nonprofit organization that advocates and supports people and their families with mitochondrial disease. To gain more information about patients and their families, MitoAction participants completed a survey that included questions about their disease, diagnosis, goodness of life, and thoughts on clinical trials. There were 158 respondents that completed this survey, with the majority being the patient themself.


MitoActions' primary goal for this survey is to identify reasons for the lack of clinical trial participation, as well as recommendations on how to increase trial participation in the future.

The analysis summary is found in the [linked markdown file.](Summary_Report.md)

The complete analysis and code is in the following [Jupyter Notebook](mtioaction.ipynb).
